# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** Owner can run the entire executive job search from one place — track companies, log interactions, move applications through pipeline stages, and surface the highest-value introduction paths — without leaving the app.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — test-infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 02 — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 2 of 4 COMPLETE
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-12

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~15 min (phase 2, plan 1)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02-test-infrastructure | 1/4 | ~15 min | ~15 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (15 min)
- Trend: On target

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-test-infrastructure P02 | 25 | 3 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap mode: standard (horizontal layers) — active work is horizontal improvements to an already-vertical shipped product, not new end-to-end user features
- Phase 1 = BUG-01 + BUG-02 (shortest path to value; user is currently blocked from daily use after large imports)
- Phase 2 = Test infrastructure placed before security/cleanup/perf so subsequent phases land safely; TEST-A3 pins the BUG-01 regression
- Vitest 4 exits code 1 on no test files — passWithNoTests: true added to vitest.config.ts to satisfy clean-checkout exit-0 contract
- PGlite bootstrap = raw SQL replay of drizzle/migrations/*.sql (CD-04); each createTestDb() call returns a fresh in-memory DB (CD-05)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BUG-01 is actively breaking daily use of the app — Phase 1 should be planned and executed immediately
- Playwright as a production dependency (not handled by v1 — deferred to v2 as JL2-02)
- LinkedIn scraping requires local dev / Docker with host browser; cannot run on Vercel serverless (acknowledged out-of-scope)
