# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** Owner can run the entire executive job search from one place — track companies, log interactions, move applications through pipeline stages, and surface the highest-value introduction paths — without leaving the app.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Critical Bug Fix (hydration crash blocking sidebar navigation)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Critical Bug Fix)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap mode: standard (horizontal layers) — active work is horizontal improvements to an already-vertical shipped product, not new end-to-end user features
- Phase 1 = BUG-01 + BUG-02 (shortest path to value; user is currently blocked from daily use after large imports)
- Phase 2 = Test infrastructure placed before security/cleanup/perf so subsequent phases land safely; TEST-A3 pins the BUG-01 regression

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BUG-01 is actively breaking daily use of the app — Phase 1 should be planned and executed immediately
- Playwright as a production dependency (not handled by v1 — deferred to v2 as JL2-02)
- LinkedIn scraping requires local dev / Docker with host browser; cannot run on Vercel serverless (acknowledged out-of-scope)

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
